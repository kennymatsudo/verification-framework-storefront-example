"""Run planned breaks in a scratch repo and guard code recording while the session is open.

Usage:
  break_session.py start REPO
  break_session.py run REPO "IDS: WHAT WAS BROKEN" -- CHECK COMMAND...
  break_session.py replay EVIDENCE_FILE -- CHECK COMMAND...
  break_session.py status
  break_session.py end REPO

--harness DIR picks the harness; it defaults to the one this script sits in, at scripts/framework/.

start makes a scratch git worktree of REPO at the commit under test, replays the developer's staged,
unstaged, and untracked changes into it, and confirms its code_state.py fingerprint matches the
developer's checkout. It then opens a session and points the app at the copy with settings.md's
Run scratch code command. Make the break as an uncommitted edit in the copy it prints.

run confirms the developer's checkout still matches and the copy holds an edit, restarts what runs
REPO when settings.md's After an edit names a command, and runs the check from the project root with
VERIFY_PLANNED_BREAK set. It saves the edit as <time>.patch beside the <time>.json evidence the check
wrote, outside the run folder so it can be committed with the record, then restores the copy to its starting state and confirms its fingerprint, whether the check
passed, failed, or crashed. When vf.py run accepted the break run, it appends one line per targeted
sub-feature whose judging step failed to evidence/breaks.jsonl, the harness's record of what was broken
and when; vf.py status reads the break's evidence itself, so nothing is written in the feature file.

replay applies the patch saved beside EVIDENCE_FILE to the repo its planned_break names and runs it as
run does, aimed at the same sub-features, to re-prove a check after its code changes. The repo's
session must be open.

end points the app back at the developer's checkout, removes the copy, closes the session, and
reports whether the developer's checkout still has its starting fingerprint. Ending a repo with no
session does nothing, so end is safe to repeat after a crash.

A session copies REPO's whole Git checkout, so settings repos in that checkout share it: run and end
take the repo start named, and a start for another of them while it is open is refused. While a
session is open, code_state.py refuses ordinary code recording on every repo in it, including --checkout
overrides. Only the harness that opened the session may run or end it, or record its scratch code.
Commands from settings.md run from the project root
with {repo} and {checkout} replaced by the repo name and the checkout path, and with
VERIFY_BREAK_SESSION set so their own code_state.py calls are not refused.

The commands must establish which code the app loaded through its doctor. Restoring files does not
restart an app or undo data changes. An interrupted session stays open until end succeeds.

Exits 0 when the step finished, whatever the check's own outcome; 1 when a guard found a problem,
such as a session already open, no edit to run, the developer's checkout changing, or no evidence
written; 2 when it could not run, with a STOPPED: line on stderr.
