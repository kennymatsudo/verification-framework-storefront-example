"""Print the Git state of every repo the harness's settings.md lists, as the evidence 'code' field.

Usage: code_state.py [HARNESS_DIR] [--checkout NAME=PATH ...]

HARNESS_DIR defaults to the harness this script sits in, at scripts/framework/. Prints one JSON object
keyed by repo name, each entry {"commit", "branch", "dirty", "dirty_hash", "on_main"}, ready to
copy into an evidence file's "code" field or a launch record. Every harness tool
that records code versions calls this instead of reading Git itself, so the
doctor, the checks, and validate.py agree on what each field means.

- commit: the full commit HEAD points at.
- branch: the checked-out branch, or null on a detached HEAD.
- dirty: a modified, staged, or untracked file outside the harness directory and
  the framework skill copies sync wrote beside it;
  files Git ignores don't count.
- dirty_hash: SHA-256 of staged and unstaged diffs and untracked contents,
  excluding the harness; null when clean. Capture this when the process loads its code.
- on_main: whether the commit is on the repo's default branch: origin/HEAD when
  the clone has it, else a local main, else master. null when none exists.

A locator that names a folder inside a checkout, such as the app's own folder in
a monorepo, scopes dirty and dirty_hash to that folder; commit, branch, and
on_main stay the checkout's. Locators resolve from the project root, the folder
holding the skills directory the harness sits in.

--checkout points one repo at another checkout, such as a scratch worktree
holding a planned break. This reports the checkout on disk, not what a running
process loaded; the doctor still establishes that, for example by saving this
output at launch and comparing it with a fresh run.

While break_session.py has a planned break session open on a repo, ordinary code
recording refuses on every repo in that Git checkout, including --checkout overrides.
Only the owning harness may record the scratch copy with VERIFY_PLANNED_BREAK set;
another repo in the same checkout is then recorded from its own folder in the copy.
Commands break_session.py runs from settings.md set VERIFY_BREAK_SESSION to the
session's repo name and get the checkout the app is being pointed at. An override
must name the folder the run would record.

Exits 0 with the JSON, 2 when settings.md lists no repos, has an invalid repo
line, a repo cannot be found or has no commit, or a session is open and the run
is not a planned break, with the reason on a STOPPED: line on stderr.
