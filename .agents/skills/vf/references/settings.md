# Settings template

Write this into the harness as `settings.md` and replace each `<...>` with what the repo uses. It holds the app's repos, requirements source, and commands. Artifact locations are fixed by `rules.md`, which is copied unchanged. `scripts/framework/vf.py validate` reads the labeled lines, so keep each label exact. Ready settings need every listed line; incomplete settings omit unknown required fields.

# <App> verification settings

The values `rules.md` refers to for this app. Change a rule in the framework that provides `rules.md`, not here.

## Setup

- Status: incomplete

## Workflow

- Requirements source: <source, or none>

## Repos

- <repo name>: <path relative to the project root, or env:<env file relative to the project root>:<key>>

List every repo whose code a check runs, including this repo when it owns running code. A single-repo harness has one line, such as `- app: .`. The project root is the folder holding the skills directory this harness sits in; in a monorepo, `.` is the app's own folder, so dirty state covers only that folder. An `env:` locator reads a checkout path from an existing project settings file at run time; do not save a developer's absolute path here.

## Commands

- Start: <start command>
- Stop: <command that stops what Start started and removes its launch record, or none when only a person starts the app>
- Doctor: <doctor command; vf.py run runs it from the project root before every check>
- Ready line: <the exact line the doctor prints when ready>
- Probe: <probe command, or none yet>
- Run scratch code: <command that points the running app at the checkout {checkout} of repo {repo}; per check, when each check starts the app itself; or none>
- After an edit: <reloads, or the command that restarts what runs repo {repo} from {checkout}>

The probe reads state without importing app code. Record working directories and startup notes beside these commands: whether the agent may start the app, and any prompt, personal login or credentials, or approval that requires the user.

When the app runs the checkout's files directly, the framework's launcher can fill the first three lines, so no app-specific doctor code is needed: `Start: scripts/framework/vf.py start --until "<ready probe>" -- <app command>`, `Stop: scripts/framework/vf.py stop`, and `Doctor: scripts/framework/vf.py doctor --probe "<ready probe>"`, where the ready probe is a shell command that exits 0 once the app answers, such as a request to its health URL. An app that reloads on edit, runs in a container built from a cache, or compiles first needs its own doctor, which may still call `vf.py doctor` for the process and the code on disk.

Reaching a real external or shared system requires the user's approval for that run. An existing non-local environment still needs a doctor that identifies its running code and explicit action permissions.

Run scratch code must make the running app load the scratch checkout's files, not this one's: start the scratch copy's entry file by path, or put `{checkout}` first on the module path and start from there. `python3 -m <package>` run from the project root imports this checkout's package even with `PYTHONPATH` set, so a break made in the copy never reaches the app. After switching or reloading code, the doctor must confirm the app loaded the requested version. `scripts/framework/vf.py break` runs the last two commands from the project root for planned breaks: Run scratch code with the scratch copy when a session starts and with the developer's checkout when it ends, and After an edit before each break's check. Use `none` when the app can't run another checkout: one instance per machine, a start only a person can do, or a shared environment. Planned breaks are then blocked.

When code has uncommitted changes, capture `code_state.py`'s `dirty_hash` at launch and compare it along with the commit, rather than relying on the dirty flag alone.
